# General aspects

The Retro Controller is a Character Controller built from scratch using only the Physics (PhysX framwork) components and API in Unity.  

It's also designed to be extensible, meaning you can create new ways for the controller to behave in different game scenarios without having to change the core code.

# Why? 

The idea of creating this character controller came from wanting to make something that behaved like Quake's character and the main Character Controller that Unity provides neither interacts with the environment in the same way as it's limited in the ways you can customize it. One of the reasons is the difference of how primitive physics worked in Quake and how it works now in frameworks like PhysX from Nvidia, which is what Unity uses.

# About feature requests

Although I appreciate feature requests, I cannot promise to implement all of them due to
the limited time I have to work on this. However, there should be a list of features that will suit most developer's needs.
